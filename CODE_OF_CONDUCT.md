The following is a document laying out the agreements that this community has gathered around. There is a group of organizers that have volunteered their time and effort to support and encourage the growth of this space. If you have any questions or concerns about this community, please feel free to contact any of these [organizers listed below](#organizers).

# The Short Version

Be respectful of other people and communicate your needs directly, respectfully ask people to stop if you are bothered; do not take advantage of this space to promote something in excess; respect privacy; and if you can’t resolve an issue with someone else you should contact the organizers. If you are being a problem, it will be made clear to you, and you may be asked to leave the Missoula Tech Slack. If you find you are particularly happy with an interaction make it stand out to the community as a positive event. In this way the community will be able to learn from your experience and grow.

# The Long Version

## Respect

The Missoula Tech Slack is an intentionally positive online community. We recognize and celebrate the creativity and collaboration of our independent members and the diversity of skills, talents, experiences, cultures, and opinions that they bring to Missoula, Montana and the world.

The Missoula Tech Slack is an inclusive environment, based on treating all individuals respectfully, while at the same time acknowledging race, gender or gender identity (including transgender status), sexual orientation, age, disability, nationality, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), political affiliation or career path. In the acknowledgement of these differential states our bodies and minds may react. We ask that you take time in this virtual space to slow down and listen to these [internal changes](#remember-you-have-a-body) before responding.

We value embodied respectful behavior above individual opinions.

Embodied respectful behavior includes but is not limited to:

- Active listening with kindness, constructive responses, and helpful commentary.
- Avoid demeaning, discriminatory, harassing, hateful, or physically threatening behavior, speech, and imagery.
- If you’re not sure, ask someone instead of assuming. No, really. Just ask the Organizers. We’d rather hear from you than hear about something you said or did after the fact, and we are here to help.
- When you notice someone modeling respectful behavior, lift them up, create space for that behavior and empower that person to be a stronger voice in the community.
- When you notice someone modeling disrespectful behavior reach out and connect or if you need support, gather the community, including the organizers, that's one reason they have volunteered, to support you in your growth.

Disrespectful behavior outside this community may be considered a violation of this code of conduct at the discretion of the Organizers.

## Self-Promotion

Excessive self-promotion of one's company, product, or paid service is not allowed here. We are here to
share a love of technology and build a community of mutual interests, not sell each other things.

## Privacy

This community is not a public space. However, no one has signed an non-disclosure agreement (“NDA”) to participate, and you should not presume anything you say here will remain private, so act accordingly. Protect IP and legally-protected information.

If you want to publicly disclose anything discussed here, use the [Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about/chatham-house-rule) as the guideline (“participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed”).

For attribution of specific content found on this Slack, we ask that you ask the originator of the content for permission. If you don’t receive consent in a reasonable period of time, we ask that you credit the “Missoula Tech Slack.”

## Remember You Have a Body

No matter what side of conflict you are on, we strongly recommend that when it comes up in Slack that you **pause and step away from your computer before engaging**. Become aware of how your body is reacting. Is your heart racing? Have your veins run cold? Are you blushing, or feeling flooded with the tiny needle pricks of mortification? If possible, move, breathe, dispel some energy, focus on something else, and stay away for at least an hour if you can. There is no urgency here, and how you react when your nervous system is preparing your body to engage with a threat will be much different than when it's not.

## Resolving Conflict

Culturally, our society is full of aggression and passive aggressiveness in how people communicate. We invite another way.

We believe direct peer-to-peer discussions, feedback, and nonviolent communication can help build a stronger and more inclusive community. It is of utmost importance that everyone feels safe to have conversations here, which includes agreeing to disagree with grace and humility.

If you see someone violating any part of this Code of Conduct, we urge you to respectfully dissuade them from such behavior. Expect that others in the community wish to help keep the community safe for everyone, and welcome your input in doing so.

If someone is being disrespectful to you, please consider addressing the issue directly with the person as a first step (preferably not by Slack message). You can provide feedback on how they made you feel, ask them questions, share observations, ask for repair (more about this in the next section), or set a boundary for yourself. If both parties have curiosity about where there is a communication misunderstanding, or where someone is feeling an unmet need, you will have a better outcome. **This is hard mode**, but leads to greater community health, healing, forgiveness, and closeness.

Sometimes this is not productive though, particularly if one party is unwilling to examine their role in a situation and their behavior escalates to abuse or manipulation. If you feel in any way unable or unwilling to engage in this process, or you attempt and it leads to more harm, please bring it to the attention of an Organizer. We can provide additional support or take further action to remove someone from the community if all other avenues have been exhausted.

## Repairing Harm

Should you catch yourself behaving disrespectfully, or if someone approaches you with an example of how you caused them harm: remember that even if your intentions are good, your actions can still hurt someone. When this happens, you have an opportunity to repair the harm you've caused. This is not easy to do, but necessary to create real growth in a relationship.

One model of repair looks like:

1. Ask the person if they would be willing for you to try to repair the harm you've caused. If they say no, respect their decision, and let them know you are available and willing whenever they are ready.
1. If they say yes, ask the person to give you an account of the impact that your actions had on them. ("How did my behavior affect you in this situation?") Listen; do not say anything.
1. When they finish, repeat back to them how you've heard that your actions had an impact on them. ("What I heard is that when I did X, you felt Y.") Try to repeat back as many details of what they said as possible, not just the overall impact.
1. Ask if you have missed anything. Give them an opportunity to add more or clarify something about how you framed their feelings.
1. Once they say you've captured their perspective, apologize and explain how you will avoid doing this same harm in the future. Do not say anything about your side, or why you did it. Just say: "I'm very sorry that when I X, you felt Y. In the future, I will Z instead and be more aware of 0."

If you both hurt each other, you can both go through a cycle of this process. The important part is making sure that each person gets one full opportunity to be heard, with one person who is hearing and stating a commitment for the future.

No one is perfect, and even well-intentioned people make mistakes. What matters is how you handle them and that you avoid repeating them in the future.
