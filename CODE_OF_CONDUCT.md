All participants in the Missoula Tech Slack are required to comply with the following Code of Conduct. Organizers (see below for definition of Organizers) will enforce this code throughout the Missoula Tech Slack.

# The Short Version

Be respectful of other people, respectfully ask people to stop if you are bothered; do not take advantage
of this space to promote something in excess; respect privacy; and if you can’t resolve an issue with
someone else you should contact the Organizers. If you are being a problem, it will be made clear to you, and you may be asked to leave the Missoula Tech Slack.

# The Long Version

## Respect

The Missoula Tech Slack is an intentionally positive online community dedicated to the growth and evolution of our local community. We recognize and celebrate the creativity and collaboration of our independent members and the diversity of skills, talents, experiences, cultures, and opinions that they bring to Missoula, Montana and the World.

The Missoula Tech Slack is an inclusive environment, based on treating all individuals respectfully, regardless of gender or gender identity (including transgender status), sexual orientation, age, disability, nationality, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), political affiliation, or career path.

We value respectful behavior above individual opinions.

Respectful behavior includes but is not limited to:

- Be considerate, kind, constructive, and helpful.
- Avoid demeaning, discriminatory, harassing, hateful, or physically threatening behavior, speech, and imagery.
- If you’re not sure, ask someone instead of assuming. No, really. Just ask the Organizers. We’d rather hear from you than hear about something you said or did after the fact, and we are here to help.
- Don’t be a bystander. Role model respectful behaviour, but also help to address disrespect when you see it.

Disrespectful behavior outside this community may be considered a violation of this code of conduct at the discretion of the Organizers.

## Self-Promotion

Excessive self-promotion of one's company, product, or paid service is not allowed here. We are here to
share a love of technology and build a community of mutual interests, not sell each other things.

## Privacy

This community is not a public space. However, no one has signed an non-disclosure agreement (“NDA”) to participate, and you should not presume anything you say here will remain private, so act accordingly. Protect IP and legally-protected information.

If you want to publicly disclose anything discussed here, use the [Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about/chatham-house-rule) as the guideline (“participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed”).

For attribution of specific content found on this Slack, we ask that you ask the originator of the content for permission. If you don’t receive consent in a reasonable period of time, we ask that you credit the “Missoula Tech Slack.”

## Resolve Peacefully

We believe peer-to-peer discussions, feedback, and corrections can help build a stronger, safer, and more welcoming community.

If you see someone violating any part of this Code of Conduct, we urge you to respectfully dissuade them from such behavior. Expect that others in the community wish to help keep the community respectful, and welcome your input in doing so.

If you experience disrespectful behavior toward yourself or anyone else and feel in any way unable or unwilling to respond or resolve it respectfully (for any reason), please immediately bring it to the attention of an Administrator. We want to hear from you about anything that you feel is disrespectful, threatening, or just something that could make someone feel distressed in any way. We will listen and work to resolve the matter.

## Apologize for Mistakes

Should you catch yourself behaving disrespectfully, or be confronted as such, listen intently, own up to your words and actions, and apologize accordingly. No one is perfect, and even well-intentioned people make mistakes. What matters is how you handle them and that you avoid repeating them in the future.
