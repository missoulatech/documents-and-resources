# Missoula Tech Slack Documentation and Resources

This repository collects documents and resources for the membership of the Missoula Tech and the Organizers responsible for establishing rapport within the community.

A good deal of this is unabashedly stolen from [Rands Leadership Documents](https://github.com/randsleadershipslack/documents-and-resources).  Feel free to continue the stealing forthwith...
