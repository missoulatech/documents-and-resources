Welcome to MissoulaTech.  We're glad you're here.  Take a minute to introduce yourself in #intros and read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/missoulatech/documents-and-resources/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).  #watercooler is a good place to listen into to get the feel of the place, #rants will give you some space to vent, and #call-of-the-mountains is a great place to share the beauty all around us.  Feel free to reach out with questions, hope you stay awhile.
